New Employee Project

## Objective

Create a team composed of a Manager / Intern / Engineer dynamically using questions to identify them by name and department . The end result would be a HTML page where all team members would be displayed for quick reference

The tools used to develop this project:
a) Inquirer
b) FS

## Procedure

a) js file will be executed and the user ( assuming the Manager ) will answer the questions related to Manager.

b) The Manager will then be presented with a list to use to fill out information for all Engineers / Interns that are part of the team.

c) once the manager had completed his team roster , he has the option of creating an HTML document displaying all the members of his team

## Result Validation

Input can be validate by the creating of the HTML document and cross referencing the display dated against what was input by the Manager

## Future Enhancements

This project can be further enhanced by diversifying the type of employees as the company
grows and adding the job title to the list of occupations to choose from when building the team
